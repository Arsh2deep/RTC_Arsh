        <h1>Arsh's Favorite Project </h1> 
        <h2>One of my Favorite Projects I have worked on was like a replica to the google dinosour jumping game we couldnt really get too far into it but it was a very great learning experience with my few programmer buddies.</h2>  
        I di have alot of fun building and learning about all the new language styles and the way how some functions may seem different but they work the same as from any other coding language.I enjoyed the challenges that came with this project, such as working with new technologies and figuring out solutions to complex problems. I also appreciated the opportunity to learn from my team members. overall, a fun learning experience.
